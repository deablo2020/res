                    <h3> 2nd day of May, 2k22</h3>
                    <p> I realised I'm being bitter, this is not me, who I truly am.
                        Why be a bitter person on first place.
                    </p>
                    <p>It only fills my heart with useless Hatred towards everything, ruins my day 
                        and all other who come in contact with me, make all the interaction that I've 
                        with outer world seemingly BITTER & all the dilemma that I internally deal with, 
                        full of resentment and sour.
                    </p>
                    <p>It's like a feedback loop, that once initiated, convinced myself that everything 
                        that is happening or will happen is against me.
                    </p>
                    <p>The feeling of Remorse that started with one single event, soon consumed 
                        me as a person, when it was left uncheck. This resentment doesn't helped, it 
                        didn't made anything better, which in turn isolated me from everything. All those words, sentences facts that weren't 
                        there on the first place, this bitterness made me firmly believe on them. Not 
                        only it ruined my mood continuously, it limited my interactions on the whole.
                    </p>
                    <p>With low interactions, so much bitterness, resntment; Anger was not far away. 
                        Each and every angered interactions just added icing to the cake, made me more bitter, 
                        gave me more reasons to resent & isolate myself. 
                    </p>
                    <div class="dd">
                        <p>Now that I've really isolated myself (in some sense). I realised these voices in my head are 
                          still talking, they aren't silenced. And these voices are telling me things, thoughts, 
                          which are not who I am. 
                        </p>
                        <p>It's then I realised these Voices aren't me, these aren't my thoughts, these thougths are being 
                          planted by that resentment and bitterness, that borne out of a single event which totally 
                          consumed me and overtook my rational sense. 
                        </p>
                        <p> Its now that when I finally realised that these voices aren't me, I'm able to see the whole picture. 
                          the world was never against me or with me. It was always as it is on the first place. It was me who made it 
                          my ally and it was those resentment who made it a foe.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <p> I mean if we can't celebrate someone's success then why ENVY it and fill ourself with useless resentment 
                        and bitterness. It just takes few words of appreciation, that brings a smile for a while on oue face and 
                        the other person and we move on. While envy ruins our whole day, creating a disgust feeling of distaste, 
                        fillimg us with bitterness and making us delusional, turning us to victim mentality, conveying ourself that 
                        everyone is just trying to drag us down.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p> It wasn't that easy to distinguish these voices from oneself and delusional, but its not impossible.
                    </p>
                    <p> Now that I can see the larger picture I see the things as they are and how delusional I was.</p>
                    <h3> See its so simple fact:</h3>
                    <p class="dark"> We hear people say, "Hey life is so beautiful isn't", and then we look at ourself 
                        and realise, "Phew! maybe mine one's is just ugly", "Why isn't my life that beautiful & exciting?". 
                        Well the fact is that life is neither beautiful nor ugly or hard or bed of roses, Life is just life, 
                        it is just as it should be. Its us who decides to call it beautiful and easygoing or ugly and unbearably 
                        harsh. I say, 'never be too much flown away by temporarily feelings. Accept it, life is just life, nor 
                        beautiful nor ugly'.
                    </p>
                    <p class="dark"> For the analogy consider Gold. Gold is merely just another metal stone lying 
                        around, like other metal stones. Its only us who decides that this particular metal stone of gold 
                        is worth enough to betray the trust of our close ones or even at extreme end, kill an another 
                        living person, in order to possess this particular metal stone of gold. I know this analogy is 
                        quite harsh but it clearly reflects our evil self that we are so scared to confront. Remember if our mind 
                        can make a mere piece of stone more worth than life of a living soul, it can very easily deceive 
                        ourself towards any delusional disbelief.
